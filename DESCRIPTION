Description: Convert between anthropometric measures and z-scores/centiles in
    multiple growth standards, and classify infant growth accordingly. With a
    simple interface to growth standards from the World Health Organisation and
    International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century, gigs
    makes growth assessment easy and reproducible for clinicians, researchers
    and policy-makers.
