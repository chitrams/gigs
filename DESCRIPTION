Description: Convert between z-scores/percentiles and anthropometric measures in
    multiple growth standards, and classify infant growth accordingly. With a
    simple, single interface to WHO Child Growth Standards and various
    INTERGROWTH-21st Standards, 'gigs' makes growth assessment easy and
    reproducible for clinicians, researchers and policy-makers.
