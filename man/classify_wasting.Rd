\title{Classify wasting according to WHO weight-for-length/height standards}
\usage{
classify_wasting(weight_kg, lenht_cm, sex, lenht_method)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_kg}{Weight measurement(s) in kg.}

\item{lenht_cm}{Length/height measurement(s) in cm.}

\item{sex}{Sex(es), either \code{"M"} (male) or \code{"F"} (female).}

\item{lenht_method}{\code{"H"} or \code{"L"} value(s) describing whether lenht_cm was recorded as recumbent length or
standing height.}
}
\value{
Factor of wasting classification(s) with levels \code{c("implausible", "wasting_severe", "wasting", "normal", "overweight")}.
}
\description{
Classify wasting (low weight-for-height) using INTERGROWTH or WHO Growth Standards depending on the gestational age
at birth for the infant. Severe wasting is less than 3 SD relative to growth standards, whereas moderate wasting is
-2SD from the median.
}
\note{
Implausible z-score bounds are sourced from the referenced WHO report, and classification criteria from the DHS
manual.
}
\examples{
# Where no lenht_method is given, classify_wasting() returns NA.
classify_wasting(
  weight_kg = c(5.75, 2.18, 3.00, 6.75),
  lenht_cm = c(67.7, 46.6, 50.0, 80.1),
  sex =  c("F", "M", "F", "M"),
  lenht_method = c("H", "L", NA_character_, "H")
)
