\title{Classify weight-for-age according to INTERGROWTH-21\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}st\if{html}{\out{</sup>}} postnatal
growth and WHO growth standards}
\usage{
classify_wfa(weight_kg, age_days, ga_at_birth, sex)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_kg}{Weight measurement(s) in kg.}

\item{age_days}{Age(s) at recording of each infant in days. Should be between
\code{0} and \code{1856}.}

\item{ga_at_birth}{Gestational age(s) at birth in days.}

\item{sex}{Sex(es), either \code{"M"} (male) or \code{"F"} (female).}
}
\value{
Factor of weight classification(s) with levels \code{c("implausible", "underweight_severe", "underweight", "normal", "overweight")}.
}
\description{
Classify weight-for-age z-scores using the INTERGROWTH-21\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}st\if{html}{\out{</sup>}}
Postnatal Growth standards or WHO Child Growth Standards depending on the
gestational age at birth for the infant. Severely underweight is less than 3
SD below the median, underweight is less than 2 SD below the median, and
overweight is > 2 SDs above the median.
}
\note{
Implausible z-score bounds are sourced from the referenced WHO report,
and classification criteria from the DHS manual.

\examples{
classify_wfa(
  weight_kg = c(7.2, 4.5, 9.1, 24),
  age_days = c(401, 185, 101, 607),
  ga_at_birth = 7 * c(27, 36, 40, 41),
