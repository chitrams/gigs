\description{
A set of nested lists containing tables with reference values at different
z-scores/percentiles for valid gestational ages in days. The list is ordered
by acronym first, then by sex and finally z-score/percentile.
}
\note{
The tables in this package are combined versions of the tables published by
Villar \emph{et al.} (2014) and Villar \emph{et al.} (2016), so they cover 133 to 300
days' gestational age. The body composition tables (\code{ffmfga}, \code{bfpfga}, and
\code{fmfga}) cover less gestational ages than the other newborn standards as the
published standards only covered 38 to 42 weeks' gestational age.
