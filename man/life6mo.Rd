\title{Data from the Low birthweight Infant Feeding Exploration study}
\format{
A data frame with 10,026 rows and 24 variables:
\itemize{
\item {\code{infantid}}{Unique ID for each infant in the dataset. First number is site, second is facility ID (1--5) for that site. The last number denotes whether the infant is a singleton or twin.}
\item {\code{motherid}}{Unique ID for each mother in the dataset. Same convention as \code{infantid}, but without sibling status.}
\item {\code{site}}{Site ID, derived from first number of \code{infantid} (1 = Tanzania; 2 = Malawi; 3 = India-Karnataka; 4 = India-Odisha).}
\item {\code{facility}}{Facility ID, derived from third number of \code{infantid} (1--5).}
\item {\code{birthdate}}{Date of birth for a given infant.}
\item {\code{visitweek}}{Chronological age in weeks when study visit occurred (0--26).}
\item {\code{visitattend}}{Was this visit attended (1 = Attended; 2 = Missed).}
\item {\code{visitdate}}{Date of visit.}
\item {\code{visittime}}{Time of visit.}
\item {\code{withdrawalrsn}}{Reason for withdrawal, if withdrawn (1 = Baby died; 2 = Mother moved away; 3 = Lost contact with mother; 4 = Mother withdrew consent; 5 = Mother died and new caregiver withdrew consent; 6 = Other; NA = No withdrawal).}
\item {\code{deliverymode2}}{Mode of delivery for baby (1 = Vaginal delivery; 2 = Caesarean delivery).}
\item {\code{birthcount}}{Number of babies born in delivery (1 = Singleton; 2 = Twins). Note: not all babies from twin births were enrolled in the study.}
\item {\code{sibling}}{Siblings enrolled in the study (1--2)}
\item {\code{sex}}{Sex of the infant (1 = Male; 2 = Female).}
\item {\code{gestage}}{Best obstetric estimate of gestational age (132--311). Note: missing or implausible (<24 weeks) values excluded from analysis}
\item {\code{preterm}}{Term status based on \code{gestage} (0 = Term (â‰¥37 weeks \code{gestage}); 1 = Preterm (<37 weeks \code{gestage}).}
\item {\code{sizega}}{Size for gestational age (1 = Small for GA (SGA); 2 = Appropriate for GA (AGA); 3 = Large for GA (LGA)).}
\item {\code{LBWtype4}}{Low birthweight type (1 = Preterm + SGA; 2 = Preterm + AGA; 3 = Preterm + LGA; 4 = Term + SGA).}
\item {\code{pma}}{Post-menstrual age in days (133--545)}
\item {\code{age_days}}{Chronological age in days derived from \code{gestage} and \code{pma} (0--245).}
\item {\code{meaninfwgt}}{Mean weight in g (1233.33--9905).}
\item {\code{meaninflen}}{Mean length in cm (35.03--72.93).}
\item {\code{meanhead}}{Mean head circumference in cm (23.20--45.73).}
\item {\code{meanmuac}}{Mean mid-upper arm circumference (5.97--17.03).}
