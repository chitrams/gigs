## Overview
Produced as part of the Guidance for International Growth Standards project,
`gigs` provides a single, simple interface for working with the WHO Child Growth
Standards and outputs from the INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> project. You will
find functions for converting between anthropometric measures (e.g. weight or
length) to z-scores and percentiles, and the inverse. Also included are
functions for classifying newborn and infant growth according to DHS guidelines.

## Installation
```r
# Install directly from the CRAN:
install.packages("gigs")

# Or install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lshtm-gigs/gigs")
```

## Conversion functions
Conversion functions are named according to the set of standards in use, the
component standard from that set, then the type of conversion. For example, to
convert *values to z-scores* in the *weight-for-GA* standard from the
*INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards* would be:
  `ig_nbs`/`_wfga`/`_value2zscore()`

Similarly, the conversion of length-for-age values to centiles in term and
preterm infants could be performed with the WHO Child Growth Standards and
INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> Post-natal Growth of Preterm Infants Standards,
respectively:

* Term infants:    `who_gs`/`_lhfa`/`_value2zscore()`
* Preterm infants: `ig_nbs`/`_lfa`/`_value2percentile()`

If the component standard is not included in the function call, it should be
passed to the `acronym` parameter of the general function call. A vector of
`acronym` values can be used if you want to convert with different standards
for each input.

### Values to z-scores/percentiles
These functions allow easy conversion from measured values to z-scores or
percentiles for the standard used.
```{r example_v2zp}
# Convert from z-scores for individual values...
ig_nbs_value2zscore(y = 0.785, gest_age = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "wfga") |>
        round(digits = 2)

# .. or for multiple inputs
ig_nbs_wfga_value2percentile(weight_kg = 0.785, gest_age = seq(175, 196, by = 7), sex = "F") |>
        round(digits = 2)

# You can do the same for percentiles
ig_png_wfa_value2percentile(weight_kg = c(2.86, 3.12, 3.12, 3.43, 3.77, 4.10),
                            pma_weeks = 40,
                            sex = "M") |>
        round(digits = 2)
```

### Z-scores/percentiles to values
These functions convert z-scores to expected anthropometric measurements. They
are mostly useful for the creation of reference curves (see below).
```{r example_zp2v}
# Convert from z-scores for individual values...
ig_nbs_zscore2value(z = 0, gest_age = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "wfga") |>
        round(digits = 3)

# .. or for multiple inputs
ig_nbs_wfga_zscore2value(z = 0, gest_age = seq(182, 204, by = 7), sex = "F") |>
        round(digits = 3)

# You can do the same for percentiles
ig_png_wfa_percentile2value(p = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9),
                            pma_weeks = 40,
                            sex = "M") |>
        round(digits = 2)
```

#### Reference curves
We can use `gigs` to generate reference curves for the standards by getting
curves for the expected weight at multiple z-scores across multiple gestational
ages. We would usually recommend [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for
such visualisation, but do not use it here to reduce our package's dependencies.
```{r example_zp2v_curves, dev = "png"}
z_score_range <- -2:2
gestage_range <- 168:230
ref <- mapply(z_score_range,
             FUN = function(z) {
               gigs::ig_nbs_wfga_zscore2value(z = z,
                                        gest_age = gestage_range,
                                        sex = "F")
             })
matplot(ref, x = gestage_range, col = 1:5, type = "l", lty = 2:6,
        xlab = "Gestational age (days)",
        ylab = "Weight (kg)")
title(main = "Weight-for-GA in very preterm newborns")
legend(x = min(gestage_range) + 1, y = ref[length(ref)], legend = 2:-2,
       title = "Z-score", col = 5:1, lty = 2:6)
```

## Classification functions
These functions allow for quick identification of at-risk infants through
classification of suboptimal growth. The cut-offs used are sourced from research
literature; you can check the function documentation to see these sources.
```{r example_classification}
# Size for gestational age
classify_sga(
        weight_kg = c(2.5, 3.2, 4.0),
        gest_age = 277,
        sex = "M"
)

# Stunting, i.e. low length increase relative to age
classify_stunting(
        lenht_cm = c(42.3, 75.4, 72.83),
        age_days = c(252, 525, 245),
        ga_at_birth = c(238, 259, 266),
        sex = "M",
        lenht_method = "H"
)

# Wasting, i.e. low weight increase relative to length/height
classify_wasting(
        weight_kg = c(5.75, 2.18, 5.30, 6.75),
        lenht_cm = c(67.7, 46.6, 55.8, 80.1),
        sex = c("F", "M", "F", "M"),
        lenht_method = c("H", "L", "L", "H")
)

# Weight-for-age, i.e. low weight increase relative to age
classify_wfa(
        weight_kg = c(2.1, 7.2, 6.1, 9.1, 9.4),
        age_days = c(435, 501, 323, 201, 154),
        ga_at_birth = c(36, 27, 37, 40, 28),
        sex = c("M", "M", "F", "F", "F")
)
```
