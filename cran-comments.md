0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
* There is no specific reference for this package, as it uses techniques from 
  multiple sources. However, references to the data and techniques used in each
  function are provided in the documentation.
* Several SAGE Publications DOIs give `403: Forbidden` errors when checked with 
  `urlchecker::url_check()`. These links are functional in web browsers.
* In the `DESCRIPTION`, the word "anthropometric" is not misspelled, but is 
  domain-specific.
